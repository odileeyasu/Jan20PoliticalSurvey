# Data transformation

We obtained the raw dataset from the official website of Pew Research Center (https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/dataset/january-2020-political-survey/). Downloading the dataset requires registering an account on the website, hence we downloaded the dataset by registering and logging onto the site. The raw data file was in .sav form, which was read and transformed into a data frame using `read_sav()` from package `haven`.
