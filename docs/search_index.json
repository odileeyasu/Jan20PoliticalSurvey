[["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation", " Chapter 3 Data transformation We obtained the raw dataset from the official website of Pew Research Center (https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/dataset/january-2020-political-survey/). Downloading the dataset requires registering an account on the website, hence we downloaded the dataset by registering and logging onto the site. The raw data file was in .sav form, which was read and transformed into a data frame using read_sav() from package haven. After all the above steps, we would get a data frame thatâ€™s ready for exploration. Since the data contains a great number of variables, we would determine which ones we would apply for step by step during our process of exploratory data analysis and visualization. So far, our idea is not to remove variables or missing values beforehand, in order to keep the completeness of the data frame. "]]
